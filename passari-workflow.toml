[package]
# Directory used for packages under processing.
# It is recommended to use a high performance and high capacity storage
# for this directory, as the workflow cannot know the size of individual
# files before downloading them.
# This should *not* be located in the same filesystem as the Redis and
# PostgreSQL, as the filesystem can otherwise get full at random due to the
# aforementioned reason.

# Directory used for storing preservation reports for each processed SIP.
# These files are not read automatically by the workflow and are accessible
# only through the web UI, meaning it is recommended to use a storage
# designed for infrequent reads.
